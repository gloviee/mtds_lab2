# Character List Manager â€” Data Structures Lab

This application implements a **character list** data structure, which can operate in two variants:
1. **Based on a built-in array (`list`)** â€” `ArrayList` implementation
2. **Singly linked circular list** â€” `LinkedCircularList` implementation

Each variant implements a full set of methods for list element manipulation: adding, deleting, inserting, searching, cloning, reversing, expanding with other lists, and more.

## ðŸ›  Implemented Methods

The `ArrayList` class implements the following methods:

- `length()` â€” list length
- `append(element)` â€” add a character to the end
- `insert(element, index)` â€” insert at any position
- `delete(index)` â€” delete an element by index
- `deleteAll(element)` â€” delete all occurrences of a character
- `get(index)` â€” get an element by position
- `clone()` â€” clone the list
- `reverse()` â€” reverse the list
- `findFirst(element)` â€” find the first occurrence
- `findLast(element)` â€” find the last occurrence
- `clear()` â€” clear the list
- `extend(otherList)` â€” extend the list with another (copied, not passed by reference)
